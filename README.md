- Weekend team limits (max 4 teams/weekend)  

### **3.3 Exporter**  
Generates files in:  
- CSV (for spreadsheets)  
- JSON (for APIs/web apps)  
- Excel (for manual editing)  

### **3.4 GUI Application**  
Built with Tkinter:  
- Fixture generation button  
- Interactive fixture table  
- Export options  
- Status notifications
